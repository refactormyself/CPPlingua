# CPPlingua
An attempt to implement a visual model of P Systems - http://ppage.psystems.eu/ using C++, inspire by Plingua Java

THIS IS MY C++ PRACTICE PROJECT. FOR NOW I HAVE NO OTHER INTENSION FOR THIS PROJECT
I have taken a different approach to my implementation of the P system from those I have seen, though I claim I am inspired by Plingua Java (that is true). I believe this concept is advanced enough to stretch C++ to it's limit. 

**TODO LIST**

- [x] Move Project to Github
- [ ] Switch from MSBuild to Cmake https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12503229/c-cli-and-cmake and https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.12/prop_tgt/COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME.html
- [ ] seprate the core library from the main project so we have 2 submodules (Core and GUI-CLI)
- [ ] Automate the build - some kind of CI/CD jagons
- [ ] Write more test
- [ ] Create GUI-qt project
- [ ] Port GUI-qt to GUI-copperspice (Nice guys)
- [ ] Implement serious features of P Systems
- [ ]
